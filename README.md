# Learning experience
This is my learning experience when I read the paper [Multi-class AdaBoost](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/SII-2-3-A8-Zhu.pdf). To learn this new algorithm, first I reviewed **AdaBoost** and its relationship with  **Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling**. Then I realized that multi-AdaBoost is natural extension of AdaBoost.
